# PWA--Text-Editor

## Description

![badgeImg](https://shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)

This Progressive Web Application is just a simple text editor, but is available to install and has offline functionality. The text editor will store text as long as the server is running, and will cache relevant files via an injectManifest service worker in order to serve them online. 

While this app came with plenty of starter code, it was tricky to navigate certain problems that could be solved in multiple ways, like the two service workers we have available to us. I also still don't understand the datablase logic, but perhaps I only need to be able to copy the right parts.
